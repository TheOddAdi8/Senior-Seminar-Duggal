This program will assign people to different seminars based on the time the form was submitted. When a student is chosen, the algorithm would check if the student would be able to fit in the seminar of their first choice. If they fit, that's where they will be assigned to go. If they don't, then the algorithm would check if the student would be able to fit in the seminar of thei second choice and so on. If a student cannot fit in any of their choices, then they will be saved for later to be randomly assigned to a seminar. For the following seminars, the algorithm would disregard previously assigned seminars.

I'm changing my idea a bit: anyone who doesn't fit into the seminar will have a higher priority to be placed in their 2nd choice (if possible). I'm also trying to make the SrSeminar_RawData.csv file easier to read *without changing the data*.
